# What it is?
I have made a lot of projects using Next.js, and am a bit lazy pasting the code I reuse constantly into every new project. My sollution was to create this ready-to-use skeleton containg some reusable features. Feel free to use it in your own projects. 


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The project has been adjusted slightly to work with Facebook's StyleX (https://stylexjs.com/)

## Getting Started

This project required the following modules:

`npm install --save @stylexjs/stylex`
`npm install --save @stylexjs/babel-plugin`
`npm install --save @stylexjs/nextjs-plugin`
`npm install --save @babel/runtime`

Instead of installing each sepparately, open a terminal in the directory with the package.json
and run `npm install`.

Afterwards you can run the project by running `npm run dev`.
